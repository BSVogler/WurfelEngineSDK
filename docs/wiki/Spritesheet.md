The sprite sheet is a data file and the image file.

We recommend the program [TexturePacker](http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker). A save file is already included in the source code. However you can use other programs. If you are please share your experiences.


### Some hints if you are using TexturePacker:
- Data Format: libGDX
- Use Trim mode "Trim". Wurfel Engine reads the offset from file.
- Size constrains should be POT.
