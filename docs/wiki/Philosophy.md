The engine has a development philosophy or "long time goals".
The engine should be a real engine for productive (also commercial) usage but also a tool to do research on new techniques in the field of isometric games.

* run on old machines (as far as possible)
* run on slow machines (as fast as possible)
* be scalable as possible (allow big scalable options in graphics quality)
* test features which are only possible in isometric (block) worlds.

The main feature of the engine is its speed in comparison to the graphics quality.

In many countries of the world people can't afford for very strong gaming hardware. Nevertheless they want to play games and shouldn't be excluded from todays games. Even in rich countries not everybody can afford some 300$+ gaming hardware.
Because the engine is also not dependent on paying customers (free, open source software ftw!) we can develop relatively modern looking games which can be played on weak computers.
