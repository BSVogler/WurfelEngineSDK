/** A {@code PathSmoother} takes a {@link SmoothableGraphPath} and transforms it by linking directly the nodes that are in line of
 * sight. The smoothed path contains at most as many nodes as the original path. Also, the nodes in the smoothed path are unlikely
 * to have any connections between them (if they were connected in the graph, the pathfinder would have found the smoothed route
 * directly, unless their connections had dramatically large costs).
 * <p>
 * Some world representations are more prone to rough paths than others. Fore example, tile-based graphs tend to be highly
 * erratic. The final appearance also depends on how characters act on the path. If they are using some kind of path following
 * steering behavior, then the path will be gently smoothed by the steering. It is worth testing your game before assuming the
 * path will need smoothing.
 * <p>
 * For some games, path smoothing is essential to get the AI looking smart. The path smoothing algorithm is rather simple but
 * involves raycast and can be somewhat time-consuming.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm assumes that there is a clear route between any two adjacent nodes in the given path. Although this algorithm
 * produces a smooth path, it doesn't search all possible smoothed paths to find the best one, but the final result is usually
 * much more satisfactory than the original path.
