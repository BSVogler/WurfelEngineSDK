Wurfel Engine uses Maven for dependency managment. Built on top of libGDX.

WurfelEngine.jar is not intended to work as a stand-alone application like the industry game engines (i.e. Unity). The engine is designed to be configured and programmed via source code in the programming language Java. This could be extended in the future.

A game engine is a huge collection of algorithms. Therefore there are many parts which can be further improved. Some improvements can be found under [Issues](https://github.com/BSVogler/WurfelEngineSDK/issues).
