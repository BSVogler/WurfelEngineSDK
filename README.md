# WurfelEngineSDK
A repo for the Wurfel Engine SDK.

Full SDK with docs can be found under releases. Please use this if you want to develop with Wurfel Engine.

Currently the WurfelEngine.jar is not intended to work as a stand-alone application like the game engine Unity. The engine is designed to be programmed with Java.
